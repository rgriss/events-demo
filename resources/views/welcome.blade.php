        <h2>Task</h2>
        <p>Create a simple web form using PHP that allows a user to sign up for an event.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The form should include fields for:
                <ul>
                    <li>first name</li>
                    <li>last name</li>
                    <li>phone number</li>
                    <li>email address</li>
                    <li>an acceptance of Terms & Conditions</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>All fields are required except for the phone number.</li>
            <li>Upon the userâ€™s submission of the form, the data should be saved to a MySQL database.</li>
            <li>After saving, if the email address has registered for any other events, those events should be displayed.</li>
            <li>The events are to be broken up into two lists, previous events and future events.</li>
            <li>Whether the email address has been used or not, there should also be a list of all upcoming events.</li>
            <li>The event lists should include the event name and date, both pulled from the database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Database integrity and security are important. There also should not be any PHP errors, warnings, or notices. The page should exhibit basic responsive behavior.</p>

        <h2>Include</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All Code.</li>
            <li>Any special information needed for displaying the page.</li>
            <li>An export of the database structure and data.</li>
        </ul>
