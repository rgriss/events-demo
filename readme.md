Here are the original requirements provided to me:

## Task

Create a simple web form using PHP that allows a user to sign up for an event. The form should

include fields for first name, last name, phone number, email address, and an acceptance of

Terms & Conditions. All fields are required except for the phone number.

Upon the user’s submission of the form, the data should be saved to a MySQL database. After

saving, if the email address has registered for any other events, those events should be

displayed. The events are to be broken up into two lists, previous events and future events.

Whether the email address has been used or not, there should also be a list of all upcoming

events. The event lists should include the event name and date, both pulled from the database.

## Notes

Database integrity and security are important. There also should not be any PHP errors,

warnings, or notices. The page should exhibit basic responsive behavior.

## Include

● All code.

● Any special information needed for displaying the page.

● An export of the database structure and data.
